# RealTimePenStrokesScanner
This repository describes our final year project entitled “Implementation of a Real-Time Manuscript  Scanner Software for Handwritten Lecturing Digitization”. The repository describes a system  designed for tackling the problem of additional necessity of a digital whiteboard for remote  lecturing purposes, in spite of the ubiquity of other personal electronic devices (smartphones,  personal computers, cameras, etc.). The project aimed at addressing that problem by providing  an emulation of a digital whiteboard using an A4 white paper, a camera and a computer software (powered by real-time image processing algorithms), thus cutting off the necessity of a digital  whiteboard. The objectives of this project targeted specifically a software whose performance  (in terms of output video frame rate, image enhancement and obstruction-free output) emulates  a digital whiteboard output for the viewer. The research methodology and the software  implementation relied on MATLAB toolboxes (Image Processing Toolbox, MATLAB App  Designer and MATLAB Compiler) and hardware components: a personal computer and a  camera. The outcome of the project was a software that complied with the set objectives but  with limitations related to input image resolution, noise and illumination non-uniformity,  perspective of the camera and output video file compression.
